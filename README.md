# Image Steganography using the LSB technique

This repository contains code created to :
	- Encrypt a message with a password (using LFSR)
	- Hide the encrypted message in an image (PNG and BMP format only)
	- Get the encrypted message from an image and decrypt it using the password

Warning : Cryptography using LFSR is not state-of-the-art. Let's say that I made "home-made cryptography".

# Python3 is required
